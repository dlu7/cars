# This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
###
**The user can choose between 3 options:**
- Option 1: Allows the user to add to the inventory of cars
- Option 2: Displays the inventory of cars (sorted by year)
- Option 3: Exits the program
The user can choose a number between 1-3 to choose one of the above actions and the program will execute the said action.

*Note: The file "My_old_cars" stores the data of the cars.*
